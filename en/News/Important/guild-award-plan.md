### Guild Doctrine
The goal is to provide more accessible services to SERO miners
Membership in a guild is entirely up to the miners' own free will
Any miner who has worked out in a week may form a guild
The SERO team is only responsible for technical support and rewards, not for union matters
The President of the Union may not enter other guilds
